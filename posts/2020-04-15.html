                    <div class="post-content">

                        <p>Following her first Academy Award nomination, Adele quickly reacted to the exciting news and thanked the Academy and her fans on Twitter. The star wrote: "Oh my god I feel like Meryl Streep!! Thank you x."</p>
                        <p>The British singer-songwriter's nomination was one of five for Skyfall, which was also shortlisted for Cinematography, Music (Original Score), Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.</p>
                        <p>The 24-year-old star is also up for a Golden Globe, also in the category of Best Original Song, and it is thought she will make her return to the spotlight this weekend at the awards</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p1.png" class="lazyload"></p>

                        <p>It will be the first time the notoriously private singer has been seen out in public since she and her boyfriend welcomed their first child, whose birth she still hasn't officially confirmed. Her spokesperson said at the time: "We are not releasing a statement at this time. No comment." It's still not known whether the baby is a boy or a girl, and the name remains a mystery.</p>
                        <p>Other Oscar nominees reacted to the news, one of the first to do so was Naomi Watts, who said she was "truly honoured" that her portrayal of Tsunami survivor Maria Belon had been recognised. She is nominated for best actress for The Impossible.</p>
                        <p>She said: "I am so thrilled and humbled with this morning's wonderful news. The journey of telling Maria Belon's miraculous story of survival has been an incredible experience and I am so grateful for this acknowledgement of our film."</p>
                        <p>Ang Lee, director of Life of Pi, which is second, after Lincoln, with 11 nominations said: "It's a great surprise. I'm deeply honoured. Eleven really surprised me. But it's a good surprise. I'm very happily surprised."</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p2.png" class="lazyload"></p>

                        <p>Harvey Weinstein produced two of the nine best picture nominees - Django Unchained and Silver Linings Playbook - and was naturally pleased.</p>
                        <p>"I am blown away! I can't say thank you enough to the Academy for their support of our films," he said in a statement. "We have a tremendous group of actors and filmmakers who we had the pleasure of working with this year, and I am so happy that their achievements are being recognised."</p>
                        <p>Eric Fellner, from Working Title, the company behind Les Miserables, said he was "so pleased" for Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway.</p>
                        <p>"They did unbelievable work. They both gave the performances of their lives." He added it was "a shame" that director Tom Hooper had not been recognised in the directing category, but said he was pleased with the film's overall success and that another of the firm's films, Anna Karenina, had four nominations.</p>
                        <p>The executive producer of the cine event has confirmed the 24-year-old singer will be at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in LA for the ceremony, where she has been nominated for Best Original Song for her 007 theme tune Skyfall. It's not known whether her other half, Simon Konecki, will escort her on the night.</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.png" class="lazyload"></p>

                        <p>It will be the first time the notoriously private singer has been seen out in public since she and her boyfriend welcomed their first child, whose birth she still hasn't officially confirmed. Her spokesperson said at the time: "We are not releasing a statement at this time. No comment." It's still not known whether the baby is a boy or a girl, and the name remains a mystery.</p>
                        <p>The glamorous Rolling in the Deep singer did announce her pregnancy in June on her official website. She wrote: "I'm delighted to announce that Simon and I are expecting our first child together.</p>
                        <p>"I wanted you to hear the news direct from me, obviously we're over the moon and very excited but please respect our privacy at this precious time. Yours always, Adele xx."</p>
                        <p>Adele's presence at Sunday's Golden Globes will add extra star power to the event, which is shaping up to be a memorable night. A host of Hollywood's most famous faces have already been announced as presenters with George Clooney and Jason Statham's chiseled features standing out from the crowd.</p>
                        <p>Other stars taking the stage include Meryl Streep, who doubtless will still have 2012's statue for The Iron Lady taking pride of place on her mantelpiece. This year, however, she will be giving instead of receiving awards. Actors Will Ferrell, Jennifer Garner, Les Miserables' Amanda Seyfried and Smash star Debra Messing complete the array of stars turning their hand at presenting.</p>
                        <p>The main job of holding together a glamorous, giddy night where anything goes falls, however, to Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. The comedy duo have previously worked together in box office sensation Mean Girls as well as on hit American show Saturday Night Live.</p>
